INSTALLATION
------------
1. Make the folder that will contain the web root. ex: /var/www/sites/adg/
2. Run: git clone git://github.com/timcrider/Practical-Assessment-Project.git html
3. This will have created: /var/www/sites/adg/html/
4. Change ownership of all the files under html/app/tmp/ to the web server. ec: chown -R apache html/app/tmp/
5. Your site should be working.

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------
1. Tested on CentOS 5.7 (Final)
2. Tested on Apache 2.2.20
3. Tested using PHP 5.3.8
4. This site must work as a subdomain, all links point to /. This can easily be fixed quickly by changing ctp files
    in the app/Views/ directory.

FILES MODIFIED
--------------
app/Config/core.php
app/Model/Actor.php
app/Controller/ActorsController.php
app/View/Layouts/default.ctp
app/View/Actors/index.ctp
app/View/Actors/add.ctp
app/View/Actors/edit.ctp

TASK GOALS
----------
1.	No login functionality is required.
Status: [COMPLETE]


2.	Data should be read from and written to a JSON file stored on a shared folder on the C-drive of the web server.
Status: [COMPLETE]


3.	User should be allowed to filter the list of actors by last name, billing rate, and interview date.
Status: [FUNCTIONAL]
 Filtering by last name and billing rate are functional. I did not get to implement range of interview dates


4.	Required content should be clearly marked, and validated before submission. 
Status: [FUNCTIONAL]
 Required fields are marked. They need to be styled, and front end validation needs to be added.


5.	Optional data should be validated before submission where appropriate.
Status: [DEPENDS ON 4]
 This will be completed when 4 is, since they both share the same structure as core fields.


6.	Reset button should exist to clear fields on add and edit screens.
Status: [FUNCTIONAL]
 This is functional, but needs styling


7.	User should be warned before deleting an actor from the system.
Status: [COMPLETE]
 Used onclick="return confirm();" on the delete links in order to force a warning and action to delete.


8.	No HTML should be allowed in the notes field.  The notes field should be restricted to 500 characters.
Status: [FUNCTIONAL]
 I have removed tags and limited the text to 500 characters in the model. This is not done on the front end.


9.	No server-side validators should be used (use asp.net validators or javascript).
Status: [NOT DONE]
 Did not have time to work on front end styling or javascript validation

10.	The application should be designed and implemented so that additional actor fields will be easy to add.
Status: [COMPLETE]
 Fields are stored in a separate json database but are referenced when building data interactions. It would
be very simple to add another manager to handle fields.
